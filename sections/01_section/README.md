# Section Handout #1

## [Section](https://see.stanford.edu/materials/icspacs106b/H08-SectionHandout1.pdf)

> Sections will meet once a week to give you a more intimate environment to discuss
course material, work through problems, and raise any questions you have. Each week
we will hand out a set of section exercises, which are the problems proposed for section
that week. While we will not be collecting or grading these problems, you will receive
greater benefit from section if youâ€™ve looked over the problems in advance and tried to
sketch solutions. Your section leader won't necessarily cover every exercise in depth, so
be sure to speak up if there are particular problems you'd like to focus on. Solutions to all
problems will be given in section so you can work through any remaining exercises on
your own. Many of our section exercises have been taken from old exams, so they are
also an excellent source of study questions when exam time rolls around.
