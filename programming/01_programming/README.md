# Assignment #1: Getting started in C++

## [Assignment](https://see.stanford.edu/materials/icspacs106b/H09-Assign1SimpleC.pdf)

> Lecture has been priming you on how to take your previous programming skills and re-deploy
them in C++, and now it's time to get to work on that! Your first assignment consists of a warm-up
task (setting up your compiler) and then writing a few simple programs to develop your C++ legs.
It's highly recommended you do the warmup as soon as possible. Hey, why not today? That way, if
you run into problems, you'll have plenty of time to resolve those issues before tackling the actual
assignment.

## Problems
> Many of the assignments in this course are single programs of a substantial size. However, this first
assignment is a set of small problems to solve in isolation. These problems were adapted from
CS106A midterm/final problems and involve only simple A-level concepts (loops, parameters,
strings, I/O, arrays, etc.), so you should find the problem-solving very straight-forward. The idea is
to become acquainted with expressing code in C++ and working with the language and library
features that are almost but not quite the same as those in Java. For each problem, you are to write a
short program to solve it. To reinforce good programming habits, you are expected to decompose
your solutions, use clean style, and include comments to explain non-obvious parts of the code. Our
solution to each program required about a page of code and typically was decomposed into 3-5
functions.
